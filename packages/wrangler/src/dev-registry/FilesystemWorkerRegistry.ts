/**
 * FilesystemWorkerRegistry manages Worker registrations using the local filesystem.
 *
 * This class provides a mechanism for registering, unregistering, and monitoring
 * Workers in a development environment. It uses the filesystem to store Worker definitions
 * and implements a heartbeat system to ensure Worker liveliness (dead Workers are removed
 * from the registry). It enables testing of multiple Workers simultaneously
 *
 * How it works:
 * 1. Worker definitions are stored as JSON files in a specified registry directory.
 * 2. A heartbeat system updates each Worker's file (mtime) timestamp every 30 seconds.
 * 3. Workers with timestamps older than 10 minutes are considered inactive and removed.
 * 4. File watchers are used to detect changes in the registry directory.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const logger = new Logger();
 * const registry = new FilesystemWorkerRegistry('./worker-registry', logger);
 *
 * // Register a Worker
 * await registry.registerWorker('my-worker', {
 *   port: 8787,
 *   protocol: 'https',
 *   host: 'localhost'
 * });
 *
 * // Get all registered Workers
 * const workers = await registry.getRegisteredWorkers();
 *
 * // Start watching the registry for changes
 * await registry.devRegistry((updatedWorkers) => {
 *   console.log('Workers updated:', updatedWorkers);
 * });
 *
 * // Unregister a Worker
 * await registry.unregisterWorker('my-worker');
 * ```

	 * - When we try to get a list of workers (loadWorkerDefinitions), if a Worker file hasn't been updated in the
	 *   last 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds), it's considered inactive and is unregistered.
